## 4. Next Steps for Arch
Based on the PM Specification (`../pm/huini-site-init/20260124_spec.md`) and this Technology Stack, the Architect should:
- Design the overall system architecture.
- Define data models for various demo types.
- Outline API endpoints and data flow.
- Propose component structure leveraging shadcn/ui.
- Plan for i18n implementation and dark/light mode.
- Consider RWD implications for component design.
